        The honey badger ranges through most of sub-Saharan Africa, from the Western Cape,
        South Africa, to southern Morocco and southwestern Algeria and outside Africa
        through Arabia, Iran and western Asia to Turkmenistan and the Indian Peninsula.
        It is known to range from sea level to as much as 2,600 m above sea level in the
        Moroccan High Atlas and 4,000 m in Ethiopia's Bale Mountains.

        With the badger being Wisconsin’s state animal, many may believe that the honey
        badger could be found right in our own backyards. The honey badger, however, is
        a whole different breed that requires much warmer climates for survival. Honey
        badger populations are typically found within the Southern African area, though
        it has been found tat some populations have spread to the Arabian, Iran, and
        Western Asian habitats (Verwey et al. 2004, Begg et al. 2005). The honey badger
        is part of a diverse community of species including various predators or mammals
        such as zebras or African elephants. In general, the most populated area of
        honey badgers is typically within African Saharan environments. Its preferred
        niche typically consists of dry grasslands or deserts, though the honey badger
        has the innate ability to adapt to a variety of environments including
        mountainous areas (Mueller, 2014). From the looks of it, this species could
        potentially survive anywhere! The honey badger even has the ability to strive
        in forest

        To survive within these typically hot and dry terrains, the honey badger
        digs tunnels generally about 9 feet in length and roughly 5 feet deep
        (Mueller, 2014). The honey badger digs out these burrows into the dusty
        soil and ultimately creates a chamber at the end of the tunnel where it
        can rest during the day (“Honey Badger”, 2014). Honey badgers may form these
        tunnels/homes in a variety of different places such as crannies between rocks,
        openings beneath larger tree roots, or even uninhabited aardvark dens
        (“Honey Badger”, 2014). When out of their burrows, honey badgers do tend to
        maintain rather wide ranges of interactions. The male species generally spans
        out in an area of roughly 200 square miles from its original den. The female
        honey badgers in general maintain a smaller area of inhabitance spanning
        generally 50 square miles. Comparing these home ranges to the badgers we
        find here in Wisconsin, the North American badger’s home only spans about 1
        square mile (Mueller, 2014).
